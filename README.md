- Data modeling strategies for SQL vs NoSQL
- Scalability and flexibility considerations
- Transactional integrity and consistency
- Querying mechanisms and their impact on performance

### Use Cases
- **SQL Databases**: 
  - Suitable for structured data and applications that require multi-row transactions.
  - Commonly used in finance, healthcare, and enterprise applications.

- **NoSQL Databases**: 
  - Ideal for handling semi-structured or unstructured data.
  - Commonly used in big data applications, content management systems, and real-time web applications.

### Future
